What is that?
-------------

The presented board is a device for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
It has been designed to show you, how to build and program custum products that can interact with their environment, control other electrical devices or communicate over different types of networks and frequency bands.
All you need to bring, is a good basic knowledge in programming.

The board is equipped with a Wi-Fi transceiver that allows you to connect to existing Wi-Fi networks, provide your own Wi-Fi network for other devices or even both at the same time.
You can set up a web server that can deal with 8 parallel connections or request data from foreign services.
With the integrated sensors, you can measure and monitor the temperature, pressure, humidity of its environment or the orientation of the board itself.
It is capable to react to events with optical or acoustic signals by activating one of the LED's or the piezoelectric speaker.
And it can send data for kilometers by the use of the integrated Sub-1 GHz transceiver.

The battery on the back (not shown) ensures that you can take it where ever you want.
Depending on the application even years of battery life would be possible.
And when the battery level is getting low, you can simply recharge it by connecting it to an USB port.

What should I use this for?
---------------------------

You don't know what to do with with a temperature and orientation sensor?
Instead you need a display and an audio output to build an internet radio?
No problem!

For one there will be more projects with other applications, microcontrollers and peripherals.
Apart from that you will learn all concepts that are needed to plan and carry out your own projects.
