What a Device is that?
----------------------

The presented board is a device for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
It has been designed to demonstrate, how to build and program custom products that can interact with their environment, control other electrical devices or communicate over different types of networks and frequency bands.
All you need to bring, is a good basic knowledge in physics, math (logic) and programming.

The board is equipped with a very cheap Wi-Fi-integrated microcontroller unit (MCU) that allows you to connect to existing Wi-Fi networks, provide your own Wi-Fi network for other devices or even both at the same time.
You can set up a web server that can deal with 8 parallel connections or request data from foreign services.
With the integrated sensors, you can measure and monitor the temperature, pressure and humidity of its environment or the orientation of the board itself.
It is capable to react to events with optical or acoustic signals by lighting up one of the LED's or generating sounds with the piezoelectric speaker (buzzer).
And it can send data for kilometers by the use of the integrated Sub-1 GHz transceiver.

The battery on the back (not shown on the image) ensures that you can take it where ever you want.
Depending on the application even months of battery life would be possible.
And when the battery level is getting low, you can simply recharge it by connecting it to an USB port.

You don't know what to do with with a temperature and orientation sensor?
Instead, for example, you need a display and an audio output to build an internet radio?
No problem!

For one there will be more projects with other applications, microcontrollers and peripherals in the future.
Apart from that, you will learn all concepts that are needed to plan and carry out your own projects.
