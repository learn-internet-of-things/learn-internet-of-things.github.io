You may know the electrical basics from your school or university.
Still there are some conventions that need to be learned.
Moreover, it could be time to refresh your knowledge.


Electricity and Polarity
------------------------

Confusion about the direction of current flow.
The flow of electrical charge carriers (electrons for example; negatively charged) to positive pole.
Electrical current from positive to negative pole.

As an illustrative example is a diode that transmits current in only one direction.

See http://cdn2.rare-earth-magnets.com/images/content/conventional-versus-electron-flow-4.jpg

In digital schematics mainly distinction between power source, often named VCC (positive pole) and ground, often named GND (negative pole).


Voltage, Current and Resistance
-------------------------------

Voltage can be understood as the level that a current operates on.
Right definition is energy that is needed to move charge within an eletrical field.
Is measured in volts (V), the formula symbol is U.

Current is the ...
In simplest case, the current amout of charge that is flown through the cross-section within a time period.
Current is further distincted into direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC).
Alternating current is needed to transport the charge over large distances.
On the following pages, it is just about direct current.
Is measured in amperes (A), the formula symbol is I.

Different voltage levels are used because the amount of current is limited on different carrier types like wires.
In order to reach the same power, the current can be reduced when the voltage is raised.
Is measured in watts (W), the formula symbol is P.

P = U * I

The current can be limited by resistors.
Also, each carrier has an internal resistance, which is the reason that the current is limited.
Each carrier has a different resistance depending on material and strength.
Is measured in ohms (Ω), the formula symbol is R.

U = R * I (Ohm's law)


Electrical Components
---------------------

Are distinguished in passive and active components.
Many components have polarity.

Active:

* transistors
* diodes
* integrated circuits

Passive:

* resistors
* wires
* motors
* generators
* batteries
* switches
* relays
* transformers


Circuits (Analog vs. Digital)
-----------------------------

Today mainly digital.

With digital IC + resistor.

Importance of some components changed.
Resistor mainly used for current limitation and logic level definition.
